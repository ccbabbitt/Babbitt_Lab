TestForPositiveSelection
========================
***RemoveDashes.py***<br>
This python script cleans Fasta alignmnents prior to performing tests for positive selection: it deletes "columns" that contain at least one gap or any non-base symbols (i.e. not A, C, G, or T).


***nonCodingSelection.bf***<br>
This is a HyPhy batch file (http://hyphy.org/w/index.php/Main_Page) 
for testing for signatures of positive selection in non-coding sequences. T
he method is an improved version of EvoNC (W.S.W. Wong and R. Nielsen. (2004) 
Detecting Selection in Noncoding Regions of Nucleotide Sequences. Genetics, Vol. 167, 949-958)
into a modified branch-site model (J. Zhang, Z. Yang, and R. Nielsen.
(2005) Evaluation of an Improved Branch-Site Likelihood Method for
Detecting Positive Selection at the Molecular Level. Mol Biol Evol 22
(12): 2472-2479).

This script allows to use introns or synonymous substitutions from
nearby coding sequences as neutral proxies for testing . You can choose to look at
positive selection on any branch and run a Naive Empirical Bayes or
Bayes Empirical Bayes algorithm (Z. Yang, W.S.W. Wong, and R. Nielsen.
(2005) Bayes Empirical Bayes Inference of Amino Acid Sites Under
Positive Selection. Mol Biol Evol (2005) 22 (4): 1107-1118) to detect
what sites are under positive selection, negative selection, or neutral.
